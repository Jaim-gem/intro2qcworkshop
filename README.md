# Intro2QC: An Introductory Quantum Computing Workshop for High School STEM Students 

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository holds the learning materials for the Introduction to Quantum Computing workshop for High School STEM Students. 

The repository contains: 

- A lesson plan for teachers and volunteers who would like to deliver the workshop on their own. (Strongly encouraged before delivering the workshop to students.) 
- Presentation slides for long and short deliveries 

The website to accompany this workshop is live at [intro2qc.uvic.ca](https://intro2qc.uvic.ca).
